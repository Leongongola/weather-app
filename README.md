# weather-app

Hie, welcome to my weather app. I started coding the web app during my #100days of code.  

This app show the current weather forecast for a particular city.
I used the open weather API to get my data for the current weather.

Used the 3D weather icons from uifreebies.net, to show the weather icon according to the weather data for that particular date.
